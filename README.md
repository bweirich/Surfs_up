## Summary
From the above analysis the temperature seems to be relatively consistent variable which will be beneficial for consistent year round business and profits.  

With Hawaii being in a tropical climate, rainfall could also be a major factor that would affect business. This would be an additional query to run for the two months to see if there is are dry and rainy seasons. 

As wind is a factor in ideal surfing conditions this would also be a weather factor to collect and query.  If there are larger or smaller swells at certain times of the year this could affect the number as well as the type of customers visiting.
